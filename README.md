If you would like to assist in the development of urChat take a look at the Issues associated with the project. Please let me know if you wish to tackle a certain issue.

A Maven pom.xml is included to assist in getting your environment up and running sooner. 

Usage
======
Ensure you've got Java 17 available on your system, download and run the latest JAR release (https://github.com/matty-r/urChat/releases). If you'd like to try out the Theme functionality, create a 'themes' directory next to the urChat.jar and download the FlatLAF.jar release and place within that directory. The theme can be selected under the client options page.

Themes

Tested with FlatLaf + IntelliJ Themes, download the below jar files and place them in a themes directory alongside the urchat.jar.

* [Flatlaf 3.2.5](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.formdev/flatlaf/3.2.5/jar?eh=)

Update History
======

### Update - v0.6.1 (03 FEB 24)
* Rename room to channel, everywhere

### Update - v0.6.0 (02 FEB 24)
* Improved updateStyles performance
* Moved the Interface options panel to it's own InterfacePanel class. Rename Panels to URPanels. Move ProfilePanel and MainOptionsPanel from components to Panels. Created ConfigKeys which pairs the Preference Key to the default value in Constants. When AddToPanel is used, the appropriate preference key can be added which will then be associated with that component - this makes it easier to save the preferences instead of needing to add it for each individual component.
* Added component-label associations and fixed setting the sizes of components
* Adds a listener to Options Panels to grab the preferences as needed
* Moved the Connection stuff into its own component
* Added support for HTTP proxy, SOCKS and HTTP are now available
* Better handling of connecting to favourites
* Added an option to show tab icons
* Improved disconnection handling when connection times out, can now reconnect to the server and all open channels.
* Implemented log4j2. This raises the file size of the jar quite a bit - it may become optional at a later stage.
* Shows an error dialog if an error is received when trying to connect.

### Update - v0.5.1 (05 JAN 24)

### Update - v0.5.0 (03 JAN 24)
* Fixed a bug where saving the font didn't automatically update the Font preview
* Added an option to customise the nick format (Similar to the date format). The word nick in the Nick format text box will be replaced with the user nick, or it'll be split in half. For example: would result in the same format as <>, or <*>. But if you want a specific prefix and suffix, it's recommended to use the word nick.
* Fixed a bug with updating styles in tabs (Servers/Channels)
* Added a profiles page to better manage available profiles, such as cloning existing profiles, rename, and deleting
* A default profile can now also be set

### Update (21 DEC 14)

* Improved MessageHandler

* Added saving of Window Bounds (X,Y,Width,Height)
* Added save settings on exit
* Added scrollpanes to Server options and client Options - also moved the Save Settings button
* Added an icon :)
* Changed how MessageHandler is instantiated through Connection.

### Update (20 DEC 14)

* Added MessageHandler - It's now much more flexible and allows it to be expanded to support many different types of messages, each with it's own accompanying method. Not 100% tested at this stage, but we no longer need to rely on Connection to do the message parsing - Connection should only be worried about receiving the text.

### Update (19 DEC 14)

* Added MessageHandler placeholder class for future message handling.

### Update (18 DEC 14)

* Fixed lock-up when change to/from Private tab - required changing how selecting a tab is handled, now uses the same method of getting what type of tab is selected as TabbedMouseListener.
* Changed some methods to use an iterator instead of an Enhanced For loop, this should help with ConcurrentModificationExceptions.
* Fixed IndexOutOfBounds error when parsing the 'message' out of receivedText by checking to make sure there are two ':' within received text. See countOfOccurences within Connection.
* Improved the layout of the option panels
* Removed the favourites panel and placed it onto the same panel as the Server options - this makes more sense as you'll be able to see what you're connecting to when you press connect.
* Added Port to the server options, defaults to port 6667
* Added Port requirement when creating an IRCServer&Connection.
* Added Real name to the server options
* Added settings as constants.

### Update (17 DEC 14)

* Package split into Frontend, Base and Backend - thanks Goofybud16

### Update (16 DEC 14)

* Changed how user status is set, it's now set through IRCUser in the constructor
* Changed how the JOIN command is handled, channels will always start with # so use this to find the channel name to join to. Also use the extractNick() method to get the appropriate username if it isn't me.
* Added check to make sure the Logs directory exists, if not then create it - thanks Goofybud16
* TODO list is now maintained on GITHUB https://github.com/matty-r/urChat/issues
* Fixed communication with multiple servers - BufferedReader and BufferedWriter of the connection class were static methods. This was a piece that hadn't been changed over during the transition to enable multiple server connections.
* Improved the handling of the TabbedMouseListener, it finds out the appropriate class of the selected tab and carries out the correct method. This will stop things with the same name closing incorrectly.
* Removed unused imports.

### Update (15 DEC 14)

* Java 7 and *nix compatibility - thanks Goofybud16
* Added change font in the channel right click menu
* Added change font globally (A bit messy right now)

* Tested connecting to multiple servers, so far it appears to be working fine.

* Added Quit to tab right click menu
* Added Show/hide users list to tab right click menu
